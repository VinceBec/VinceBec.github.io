          <h4>Past Experience</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Volunteered at a Library located at Lake View Terrance for about a month. It was very fun and relaxing!</li>
            <li>Worked at Upgrade Insurance for several years as an assistant. I was no agent, but I did help locate important documents to help solve company financial disputes.</li>
            <li>Worked as a cashier at an El Super supermarket. It was interesting dealing with the public constantly, but it was also very tiring.</li>
            <li>Attended an NSF sponsored Data Science program at CSUN for about 30 days during the Summer of 2019. The program coordinators and instructors were very kind and helpul in teaching us students in various subjects related to Data Science such as data cleaning, data transformation, statistical modeling and visualisation, and some machine learning.</li>

         <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <img src="images/Earthbound.gif" alt="Girl in a jacket">
         <p>I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, reading manga, and japanese light novels.</p>

         <h2>I'm also interested in computer hardware.</h2>
         <p>My current laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad X220 that I like to occassionally tinker with. It's very old and bulky looking but it works well as a portable device for school work.</p>
         <p>At home I have a custom built desktop PC. It's extremely satisfying to assemble a desktop PC and having it work. I've even helped assemble a PC for others in the past. Eventually I'll get around to posting my current computer specifications and an image.</p>
